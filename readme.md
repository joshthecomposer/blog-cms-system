# A CMS Blog System

**Live Link [Here.](http://myapp10-dev.eba-2pnapweq.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)**

This is a blog system I am developing which I will use for my personal website. It will allow full content management, and an easy way to write blogs, upload images, embed media, etc.  
It works by allowing you to add content such as headers, textblocks, tweet embeds, etc. and the backend will save the order and layout of the blog. 

### Project Management:
* Trello
* Figma

### Tech Stack:
* React Client
* TailwindCSS
* ASP.Net API
* PostgreSQL Hosted on AWS RDS.
* S3 for image upload

### Finished Features:
* Compiling down to html after editing blog for the most solid performance for the end blog viewer.
* Drag and drop reordering of blog content.
* Users can add textblocks which will auto-grow to give the user a feel for how the final blog will look.
* Users can add headers
* Users can upload images via S3
* Users can embed tweets by pasting a tweetId

### Upcoming:
* Front end styling/beautification
* More content types
* Hyperlinking within a textblock.
* Youtube embed
